# PHP_members_catalogue
Simple website with a members catalogue using PHP and MySQL.

If you want to view the site you have to:

Create a database in phpMyAdmin (or similar) called catalogue and import the members_catalogue.sql file

Using xampp:

Create a Folder in C/xampp/htdocs/PHP and name it whatever suits you. I personally named it members_catalogue.

Start your apache server and MySQL server in Xampp control panel

Open your Browser and navigate to localhost/php/yourfoldername/browse.php

Try adding-removing or editing members to check that everything works.
